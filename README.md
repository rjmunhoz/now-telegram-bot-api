Now Telegram Bot API
===

Simple JavaScript / TypeScript library that can be used to developt serverless Telegram chatbots, deployable on Zeit's now.sh

## Usage

There's no much documentation yet, but you can find examples on the repos below, from where I extracted the code for this library.
Roughly the same files that exist here exist on those repos in the `lib` folder, with `telegram.ts` being the equivalent to this library's
